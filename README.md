## Frontend -- create-react-app

The frontend was created by running `npm run dev`. There is 
only enough here for a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how to call the 'express' backend.

## Backend -- express web server

Simple 'express' web server with two pre-made routes. Enough is here to demonstrate 
a proof-of-concept for how to respond to requests from the frontend.
